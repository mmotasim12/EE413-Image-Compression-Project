# EE413 Image Compression and Classification Project

## Overview

This project applies **image compression** and **classification** using **wavelet transforms** and **compressed sensing** to the **Mini-ImageNet** dataset. The project demonstrates fine-tuning deep learning models (ResNet18) to handle compressed data.

## How to Use

1. Open the [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/) from this repository.
2. Run the cells in order to train models, perform image compression, and evaluate performance.
3. Make sure the necessary datasets are loaded into the notebook or use the provided data links.

## Dependencies

- `torch`
- `torchvision`
- `pywt`
- `cvxpy`
