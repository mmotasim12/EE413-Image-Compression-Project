# EE413 Image Compression and Classification Project

## Overview

This project focuses on image compression techniques using wavelet transforms and compressed sensing, applied to the Mini-ImageNet dataset. We evaluate the impact of compression on deep learning model classification and improve robustness by fine-tuning models on compressed data.

## Repository Structure

- `src/` - Python scripts for data loading, model training, compression, and evaluation
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis and visualization
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
